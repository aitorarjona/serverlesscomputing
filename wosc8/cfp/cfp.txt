Eighth International Workshop on Serverless Computing (WoSC8)

   Part of [1]ACM/IFIP Middleware 2022.

   The workshop will be held hybrid this year with virtual and on-location
   format. Please note that we are being informed by the Middleware '22
   conference organizers that although they will support a hybrid format
   for the workshops, the steering committee wants the main conference to
   be held in an in-person format only. So, prospective attendees of the
   workshop should keep this in mind if they plan to attend the main
   conference also

   Over the last seven years, Serverless Computing (Serverless) has gained
   an enthusiastic following in industry as a compelling paradigm for the
   deployment of cloud applications, and is enabled by the recent shift of
   enterprise application architectures to containers and microservices.
   Many of the major cloud vendors have released serverless platforms,
   including Amazon Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Microsoft Azure
   Functions, IBM Cloud Functions. Open source projects are gaining
   popularity in providing serverless computing as a service.

   Recently, Kubernetes gained in popularity in enterprise and in
   academia. Several open source projects such as OpenFaaS and Knative aim
   to provide developers with serverless experience on top of Kubernetes
   by hiding low-level details. Auto-scalable Multi-tenant Kubernetes
   deployments like Google Cloud Run or IBM Code Engine also overcome
   previous limitations of Serverless Functions like duration, networking,
   and higher granularity (more vCPUs).

   Serverless architectures offer different tradeoffs in terms of control,
   cost, and flexibility compared to distributed applications built on an
   Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) substrate. For example, a serverless
   architecture requires developers to more carefully consider the
   resources used by their code (time to execute, memory used, etc.) when
   modularizing their applications. This is in contrast to concerns around
   latency, scalability, and elasticity, which is where significant
   development effort has traditionally been spent when building cloud
   services. In addition, tools and techniques to monitor and debug
   applications aren't applicable in serverless architectures, and new
   approaches are needed. As well, test and development pipelines may need
   to be adapted. Another decision that developers face is the
   appropriateness of the serverless ecosystem to their application
   requirements. A rich ecosystem of services built into the platform is
   typically easier to compose and would offer better performance.
   However, composing external services may be unavoidable, and in such
   cases, many of the benefits of serverless disappear, including
   performance and availability guarantees. This presents an important
   research challenge, and it is not clear how existing results and best
   practices, such as workflow composition research, can be applied to
   composition in a serverless environment.

   As this year the workshop is virtual and we are looking not only for
   research papers, experience papers, demonstrations, or position papers
   but also for live presentations of ongoing work, demonstrations, and
   anything else that may be interesting to workshop audience.

       applications
     * Debugging serverless applications
     * Programming models
     * Use cases, experiences
     * Benchmarks
     * Cost models, pricing models, and economics of serverless
     * DevOps
     * Other topics related to serverless computing

Papers and Submissions

Papers submissions

   Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished
   research/application papers that are not being considered in another
   forum.

   Submitted manuscripts should be structured as technical papers and may
   not exceed six (6) single-spaced double-column pages using ACM SIGPLAN
   style, which can be found on the ACM template page. The page limit
   contains all the content, including bibliography, appendix, etc.

   Submitted papers must adhere to the formatting instructions of the ACM
   SIGPLAN style, which can be found on the [3]ACM template page. The font
   size has to be set to 10pt.

   Note that submissions must be double-blind: authors’ names must not
   appear, and authors must make a good faith attempt to anonymize their
   submissions.

   The Middleware conference organizers will provide companion proceedings
   including all workshop papers, which will be available in the ACM
   Digital Library. This is subject to the availability of their
   camera-ready papers by October 10, 2021.

   Authors should submit the manuscript in PDF format. All manuscripts
   will be reviewed and will be judged on correctness, originality,
   technical strength, rigour in analysis, quality of results, quality of
   presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference attendees.
   Papers conforming to the above guidelines can be submitted through the
   paper submission system powered by HotCRP
   ([4]https://wosc8.hotcrp.com/).

   All submitted manuscripts (following MIDDLEWARE conference requirements
   on formatting and page limits) will be peer-reviewed by at least 3
   program committee members. Accepted papers with confirmed presentation
   will appear in the conference proceedings as well as in the ACM Digital
   Library.

Other submissions

   Authors are invited to submit proposals for demos and other
   presentations that are not papers.

   Proposals must be submitted as short abstracts (not longer than one
   page) in PDF format using the paper submission system HotCRP
   ([5]https://wosc8.hotcrp.com/).

   Accepted presentations will not be part of the conference proceedings
   but will be part of the workshop agenda with dedicated time for live
   presentation (with video backup), questions etc.
