        <h3>#1 - Elastic Data Streams in Pravega for Serverless Computing</h3>

        <p class="lead">
          <strong
            >Serverless frameworks enable applications to react to new input. As input, such as events in an event stream, becomes available, serverless frameworks trigger functions to process them. Functions can range from simple stateless transformations
            (e.g., filtering) to more complex stateful computations that are an integral part of a data pipeline. Combining streaming data and serverless can achieve low-latency, scalable and cost-effective over unbounded data sets.</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          <strong
            >To enable streaming data with serverless, it is necessary to have streaming data sources in place. Those sources can be the elements generating the data (e.g., sensors) or systems used to ingest and persist streaming data. One such a system is
            Pravega. Pravega is a novel open-source storage system for data streams. Pravega provides client applications with write/read functionality and it guarantees that streams data is durable and consistent. As a storage system, Pravega is able to store
            historical streaming data in a cost-effective way and with high performance, allowing serverless applications performing historical analysis.</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          <strong
            >One of the most distinguishing features of Pravega compared to other systems (like Apache Kafka or Apache Pulsar) is its ability to change the degree of parallelism of a stream dynamically, making event streams elastic. Pravega enables dynamic
            changes to the number of parallel Stream segments (i.e., similar to "topic partitions" in Kafka) according to the load that the cluster handles. Pravega relies on a user-defined, auto-scaling policy per stream to trigger scaling. In this talk, we
            provide a general overview of Pravega, focusing on Stream auto-scaling and its design. In addition, we discuss stream scaling and how this elasticity can be exploited by the serverless and data analytics engines to process data from Pravega
            streams.</strong

        <h3>#2 - Federated FaaS for Flexible Scientific Computing</h3>

        <p class="lead">
          <strong
            >Growing data volumes and velocities are driving exciting new methods across the sciences in which data analytics and machine learning are increasingly intertwined with research. These new methods require new systems to enable computation to be
            mobile, so that, for example, it can occur near data, be triggered by events (e.g., arrival of new data), or be offloaded to specialized accelerators. They also require new design approaches in which monolithic applications can be decomposed into
            smaller components, that may in turn be executed separately and on the most suitable resources. The federated function-as-a-service (FaaS) model presents an attractive interface to address such needs as it abstracts underlying infrastructure almost
            entirely. In this talk, I describe how we have adopted the FaaS model and adapted it to enable computation to be dispatched to a federated ecosystem of remote computing endpoints. I will present our experiences applying the federated FaaS model to
            various scientific applications and highlight the benefits and limitations of the approach.</strong

        <h3>#5 - Serverless Bomberman: RTMPG PoC based on Durable Functions</h3>

        <p class="lead">
          <strong

            applications with eventual consistency given reasonably sized volumes of data. By playing Serverless Bomberman, variations in latency become visually apparent. We ponder about the applicability to a wide range of medium-complexity games that could
            benefit from massive elastic scaling, for instance due to popularity bursts.</strong

            frameworks in Huawei Cloud, along with our on-going research problems and vision for making serverless computing a ubiquitous building block of any cloud computing service.</strong
