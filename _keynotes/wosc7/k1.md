abstract: >
          Over the last several years, serverless has gained a tremendous amount of traction among organizations large and small. From the scrappy, one-person startup, to the Fortune 500 enterprise, serverless has changed the way developers are building, deploying, and maintaining their applications. However, the rapid speed of that change has left most of them with a patchwork of tools, frameworks, and practices. At best, this is suboptimal, and at worst, it's completely unsustainable. In this talk, we'll look at how organizations are integrating serverless into their workflows and discuss where improvements can be made to tooling, CI/CD, and other processes to optimize developer productivity and dramatically reduce time-to-value (TTV) and total cost of ownership (TCO).
