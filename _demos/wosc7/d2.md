Serverless computing is a recent paradigm to program the cloud. It allows to execute user-defined functions at scale, on demand, and in a pay-per-use manner. In this talk, we detail the usage of the serverless shell (sshell). sshell allows to run shell scripts on a serverless platform much like with a regular computer. It permits to reuse an existing code base while benefiting from the massive power of serverless and paying only for the resources being used. We present a sam- ple application mining an open dataset of web pages, as well as the auto-parallelization of some of the scripts created for the Unix 50 Challenge.
