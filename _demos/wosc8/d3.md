Serverless computing gained significant popularity since it allows
developers to build scalable applications with elastic resource
management. While the ease of managing cloud resources is
unprecedented, the performance of serverless functions does not always
match expectations. Functions are limited by slow invocations and low
I/O performance, and the black-box nature of cloud systems prevents
deep insights into the limitations of the platform. Since this new
field lacked an automatic, representative, and easy-to-use
benchmarking platform, we introduced SeBS, a serverless benchmark
suite. Since that time, SeBS has been extended with support for
serverless workflows, serverless communication, and OpenWhisk
platform.
